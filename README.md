🤖 The Terminator's Code Section ⚡
Our system has been fine-tuned and supercharged, much like the legendary Terminator himself! Here’s an example of the robust code that powers this amazing project:

python
Copy code
class TorasoghTerminator:
    def __init__(self, name="Torasogh"):
        self.name = name

    def activate(self):
        print(f"{self.name} activated! Ready to terminate inefficiency.")
    
    def terminate_issue(self, issue):
        print(f"Terminating: {issue}")
        return f"{issue} successfully terminated."

# Example usage:
terminator = TorasoghTerminator()
terminator.activate()
terminator.terminate_issue("low performance")
